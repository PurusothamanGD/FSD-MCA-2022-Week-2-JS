# Scheduling Computation

## Scheduling a Code Execution
As a programmer, you won't want your program to perform every action immediately. In some situations, you'll need to design your program to perform an action at a specified time. For example, if you are developing a retail website you may want to display a pop-up message with a discount offer after a customer has been browsing on the page for a while. You can do this with the timeout function in JavaScript.

### You task in this activity is to do the following:

- Create a function in JavaScript that will display the words "Hello World" on the console.
- Delay the execution of the function you created by three seconds by adding the timeout function.

## Wondering where the "Console" is?
The browser console is a developer tool that helps you visualize what is happening on your web page. It displays all sorts of helpful information like page script errors that will help you debug issues as you build your web application.

To access the console, follow these steps:

- Locate the Web Browser pane on the bottom-right corner of this page.
- Right click anywhere on that pane and click on "Inspect"
- A new pane will now be visible on your page.
- Locate the Console tab at the top of the new pane.
- Congratulations! You have found the browser console.

Alternatively, you could always show the console log by hitting the F12 key on your keyboard at any moment while on this page.

__Note:__ _If you see messages in your console that are highlighted in yellow, do not worry. They are just informational messages about the current page you're on. To remove these messages, click anywhere on the console pane to highlight them, then hit CTRL+L on your keyboard if you're on Windows, and Command + K button if you're on MacOS_

## Checking results
After you're done adding your code for this task, you can check if your code works by examining the console output to locate the message "Hello World". When you're confident that your code works, click on the check box below to validate the task.
